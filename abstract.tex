Bitcoin is a digital currency built on a decentralized, peer-to-peer, permissionless network. Bitcoin transactions need are broadcast and then stored by every node in the network, presenting a scalability challenge for the technology. One of the solutions proposed to solve this scalability problem was the \acrfull{ln}, an overlay network layered on top of the bitcoin network in which transactions are not broadcast but instead routed through the network.\\
This thesis describes a new routing protocol called \acrfull{ldr} that can be used for transaction routing in the \acrshort{ln}. The goal of the protocol is to maximize the probability of successfully routing a transaction between a paying and a payee node while keeping the decentralized nature of the network, safeguarding performance and optimizing fees. This is achieved by splitting the work of finding a route between the nodes that constitute it, using and sharing each node's local knowledge of the network to make better routing decisions and achieve a bigger payment success probability.\\
A high-level overview of \acrshort{ldr} was presented, its specifications were defined and used as the basis for the implementation of the protocol. Promising results were obtained after simulating \acrshort{ldr}'s performance and comparing it to the performance of the current implementation, with the biggest performance differences being felt on larger networks and higher volume payments.
